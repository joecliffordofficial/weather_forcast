# Weather Forcast

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

Here is my weather forcast! Now as a traveler you can see what the next 5 days will look like when you enter a city! This will be so useful when you decide to travel next (If Covid ever ends). 

Here are the links to the repository and the actual page.
